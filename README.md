# SARS: Sobh Awesome Rice System
An automated configuration script for Unix-like operating systems. Inspired by
[Luke Smith's](https://lukesmith.xy) [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz/).

## Objectives
1. KISS. Be as simple as it could be.
2. Portability. Target multiple Unix-like systems, namely Arch, Void, and
   OpenBSD. Additionally, it should be trivial to add support for other unices.
3. Idempotence. Why use Ansible, when you can use a simple shell script?
4. Autonomy. The script should run with minimal user interaction.
